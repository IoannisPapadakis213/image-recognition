Subject: Submission of Image Analysis Project Documentation

I have prepared detailed documentation and a Presentation that thoroughly describes each component of our project. This documentation will guide you in setting up and running the program efficiently.

To run the program, please follow these steps:

1)Open Visual Studio Code or your preference compiler.
2)Open the Whole file Image_Analysis_program on Visual Studio/preference compiler.
3)Navigate to gui.py
3)Open a new terminal within Visual Studio Code/your compiler.
4)Enter the command: streamlit run gui.py
5)Executing this command will launch our application in your web browser, where you can upload images by inputing them and view the analysis results.

Examples of inputs:
alexis.jpg
corn.jpg
onion.jpg
Banana.jpg

Thank you for your understanding and support. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you encounter any issues or have any questions regarding the setup or operation of the program.

Best regards,
